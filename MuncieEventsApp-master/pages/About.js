<Text>
  <Text style ={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Free:</Text> A community calendar should be free for everyone to view and contribute to.
</Text>
<Text>
  <Text style ={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Democratic:</Text> The contents and function of a community calendar should be determined by the community.
</Text>
<Text>
  <Text style ={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Egalitarian:</Text> All demographics, event types, and genres of expression should be promoted equally in order to break down social barriers and unite disparate components of the community.
</Text>
<Text>
  <Text style ={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Decentralized:</Text> A decentralized, multifaceted approach to distributing a database of event information allows it to reach a wider audience by a variety of methods and with the participation of community partners.
</Text>
<Text>
  <Text style ={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Evolving:</Text> The development of an online community calendar should be an ongoing process, guided by the community that it serves and the advancement of web technology.
